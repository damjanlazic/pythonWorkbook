Exercise 165: Greatest Common Divisor
(24 Lines)
Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately 2,300 years ago. His
algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers, a and
b, is both efficient and recursive. It is outlined below:
If b is 0 then
Return a
Else
Set c equal to the remainder when a is divided by b
Return the greatest common divisor of b and c
Write a program that implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm and uses it to determine the
greatest common divisor of two integers entered by the user.
