In this small file we shall demonstrate, however stupid it might seem, that some programs work while others just don't!? Shall I go on and point out that... well to say the least, 666 is the number of the beast: and so we are here to "do the right thing", by stretching the stupid ring.
However, neva' say never!
So be dumb, and not so clever!
